Section - Woking Street

Woking Street is a room. The description is "You're standing halfway down the street. Snow gently wafts down in large amounts, covering what fell minutes before, undisturbed except for the area directly in front of you.[first time][paragraph break]To the west, the flickering [gaslights] in the square seem much further away than fifty paces. Fifty paces to the east the street dead-ends into a small cul-de-sac.[only]"

[Add description of footstep/carriage area. "...numerous footsteps around where the carriage once stood."]

	The gaslights are scenery in Woking Street.

	The cul-de-sac is scenery in Woking Street. ["in Woking Street"?]
	
	The description of the cul-de-sac is "A small roundabout with a sputtering [fountain] in the center closes off the street to the east."
	Understand "close" or "dead end" or "impasse" or "blind alley" or "dead-end" or "dead-end street" or "roundabout" as cul-de-sac. 
	
	The fountain is scenery in Woking Street. ["in Woking Street"?]
	The description of the fountain is "The water in the small, sputtering fountain vainly battles to remain upright against the frigid winter wind that swirls around the area."

	Going west in Woking Street is wandering.
	Going northwest in Woking Street is wandering.
	Going northeast in Woking Street is wandering.
	Going east in Woking Street is wandering.
	Going southeast in Woking Street is wandering.
	Going south in Woking Street is wandering.
	Going southwest in Woking Street is wandering.
	
	Instead of wandering: say "You shiver in the cold wind, drawing your light jacket closer around you. You really should get inside since you're not dressed appropriately for this winter weather."
	
The front door is north of Woking Street and south of the Entry Hall. The front door is a door. It is openable and lockable.
[Should Mrs. Watchett lock the front door? You can get outside by yourself to search for the key but what about getting back in?]

	The description of the front door is "[if location is Woking Street]At first glance the door to 68 Woking Street is indistinguishable from every other door that lines the street, except for the unusual [knocker] in the shape of a [sundial].[otherwise]You see nothing special about the heavy, wooden door leading to the street outside."
	
	The initial appearance of the front door is "[if location is Woking Street]The front door to 68 Woking Street is to the north.[first time] The light escaping from the drawn curtains on either side looks invitingly warm.[only][otherwise]The door to the street outside is to the south."
	
	The knocker is scenery. [no "in Woking Street". Probably should be supported by front door]
	The description of the knocker is "TBD - knock, knock, who[apostrophe]s there?"
	
	The sundial is scenery. [no "in Woking Street". Probably should be supported by front door]
	The description of the sundial is "TBD - what light upon yonder window breaks?"
	
	["68 Woking Street" in front door description. What about the number "68" as scenery?]
