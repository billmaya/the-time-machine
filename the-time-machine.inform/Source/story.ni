Volume - Beginning The Story

The player is in Woking Street.  [the Main Room. [for compass test] ]
The description of the player is "You[']re not very introspective, preferring to focus your analytical talents on your clients and your legal work[first time]. However, if you were in the mood to indulge yourself, the description of a middle-aged man whose hard work and successes allow them to enjoy all the benefits of this modern age would be appropriate[only]."

Understand "player" or "protagonist" or "lawyer" as yourself. [https://intfiction.org/t/understand-something-else-as-the-player/54102]

The current-year is text that varies.
The current-year is "1895".

debug-mode is a truth state that varies.
debug-mode is false. [true.]

To say introduction:
	say "'Let me go!' Wells fights against the orderlies attempting to drag him to the horse-drawn ambulance parked in the street. He pulls himself free, stumbling into you, almost knocking both of you to the ground.

	'I[']m not crazy,' he says, his eyes frantic. 'I know my story sounds insane, but every word of it is true. You believe me, don[']t you?'

	Dr. Humboldt intervenes. 'Wells, of course we believe you. You[']ve just had a terrible shock; you need to rest after all of these...time traveling adventures of yours. Plenty of time to sort it all out after you[']ve had a bit of a rest. Nothing to worry about.' He motions to the two orderlies.

	You look at the doctor and back at Wells, not knowing whom to believe. Wells is your oldest friend but the doctor makes a good point, especially after the story you[']ve just heard. Morlocks. Eloi. Time travel. It sounds like fantasy.

	'I can prove it all,' Wells says. He fumbles in his vest pockets as the orderlies grab him once again. 'In my workshop you[']ll find...get your bloody hands off of me! Damn you! Let me go!'

	Wells struggles against the orderlies but they[']re prepared and overpower him into the ambulance. So violent is Wells['] struggle that his pocket watch falls to the street.

	Humboldt notices your concern. 'Don[']t worry,' he says. 'They're professionals, not a rough as they look. Used to dealing with patients like this all the time.'"

	now the time of day is 10:00 PM;
