Volume - Beginning The Story

The player is in Woking Street.
The description of the player is "You rarely think of yourself in those terms, prefering to focus your prodigious logical and legal faculties on the work that your profession and your clients demand.[first time] But if you had to waste time on something so introspect you might describe yourself as a middle-aged man who has reached a certain station in life where success and social esteem allow you to enjoy all the benefits of this modern age.[only] Truly this is the best of times." [Mention something about Wells here?]

Understand "player" or "protagonist" or "lawyer" as yourself. [https://intfiction.org/t/understand-something-else-as-the-player/54102]

The current-year is text that varies.
The current-year is "1895".

The numeric-year is a number that varies.
The numeric-year is 1895.

debug-mode is a truth state that varies.
debug-mode is true.

To say introduction:
	say "'Let me go!'

Wells struggles against the efforts of the two orderlies who are dragging him towards the horse-drawn ambulance parked in the street. Desperate, he pulls himself free and stumbles into you, almost knocking the both of you to the ground.

'My friend, I[']m not crazy,' he says, his eyes desperate and pleading. 'I know my story sounds insane, but it[']s true. Every word of it. You believe me, don[']t you?'

Dr. Humboldt intervenes, placing himself between you and Wells. 'There, there, Wells. Of course we believe you. You just had a terrible shock; you need to rest after all these...time traveling adventures of yours. Plenty of time to sort it all out after you[']ve had a bit of a break. Nothing to worry about.'

You look at the doctor and back at Wells, not knowing whom to believe. Wells is your oldest friend but the doctor makes a good point, especially after the story you[']ve just heard from Wells['] own mouth. Morlocks. Eloi. Time travel. It sounds fantastical.

'I can prove it all,' Wells says. He starts fumbling in his vest pockets, looking for something. 'In my workshop you[']ll find...get your bloody hands off of me!' The orderlies have grabbed Wells a second time. 'No, damn you! Let me go!' 

Wells forgets whatever he was looking for in his pockets and struggles against the orderlies but they[']re prepared this time and manage to overpower your friend and manhandle him into the ambulance. But it[']s a near thing, so violent that Wells['] pocket watch falls to the ground during the struggle.

Humboldt notices your concerned look. 'Don[']t worry,' he says. 'They[']re professionals, used to dealing patients like this all the time. They[']re not being as rough with him as they look.'"

Gernsback is in the Library.

The description of Gernsback is "The perfect picture of Victorian masculinity and success in his double breasted lounge suit, his tailored attire offsets the somewhat brutish features below a high forehead and thinning hair styled in a combover, his only concession to vanity. It's said around town that his piercing gaze misses no chance to increase his family fortunes."

Gernsback is scenery. [This prevents "You can see Gernsback here." being printed out in room descriptions.]

Part - Morlock Endgame

[Writing ยง8.18. Randomness]
[Writing ยง9.4. When play ends]

[Removed the Bottom Well wandering code that kicks this off.]
Instead of wandering in the Bottom Well:
	if morlocks-attacked is true:
		if the player has the poker:
			say "Even with a weapon you shouldn't try your luck, especially without a source of light and possibly some allies. I mean, you barely escaped from your first encounter with these brutish savages.";
		otherwise:
			say "I don't fancy you would want to try your luck a second time in that darkness, especially without a weapon. I mean, you barely escaped from your first encounter with those mongoloid underdwellers.";
	otherwise:
		if a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds:
			if the player has the poker:
				say "You start down the [noun] tunnel without a light or a map towards the sound of the nearest machinery. Suddenly, without warning, multiple pairs of brutish hands reach out of the darkness and attempt to grab you. With a strength born of desperation and fear, you flail at them with the poker and drive what must be Morlocks off into the darkness. Retreating in what you hope is the correct direction, you find yourself back at the bottom of the shaft.";
				now morlocks-attacked is true;
			otherwise:
				if a random chance of 2 in 3 succeeds:
					say "You start down the [noun] tunnel without a light or a map towards the sound of the nearest machinery. Suddenly, without warning, mongoloid hands reach out of the darkness and grab you. By some miracle you are able to beat off your attackers and retreat back to the bottom of the shaft.";
				otherwise:
					say "You start down the [noun] tunnel without light or map towards the sound of the nearest machinery. The light fades as you proceed down the tunnel until you are in near absolute darkness. The noise of machinery gets louder and louder with each step you take.[paragraph break]Suddenly, without warning, multiple pairs of brutish hands reach out of the darkness and grab at you. You fight back valiently but, outnumbered and without a weapon, you are quickly overwhelmed by the negroid shadows and knocked unconscious.[paragraph break]Later, you regain consciousness in the freezing cold in some storage room carved out of solid rock. Shivering, you look around. Surrounding you are the naked bodies of Eloi, male and female, suspended on hooks, future fodder for the Morlocks. You bang on the door in horrror but the omnipresent and overwhelming sound of machinery drowns out your screams. Exhausted, you slump against the wall and soon succumb to the freezing cold, wishing you had believed Wells from the start.";
					end the story finally;
				now morlocks-attacked is true;
		otherwise:
			say "You start down the [noun] tunnel but without a light or a map you wander unsuccessfully in the darkness, eventually returning to where you started. Maybe you'll have better luck in another direction.".
