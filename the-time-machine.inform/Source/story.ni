Part 1 - Beginning The Story

The player is in Woking Street.

[TBD Describe yourself when you "x self"]

When play begins: say "'Let me go!'

Wells struggles against the orderlies attempting to drag him into the horse-drawn ambulence parked in the street before the door. With strength born of desperation he breaks free and falls to the ground, thrown off balance by the straightjacket that binds his arms to his sides. You kneel down and help Wells up off the snow-covered bitumen. As Wells struggles to his feet your eyes meeting.

'Save her,' he says, voice ragged and hoarse, eyes hopeful and pleading. 'Save Weena for me, my old friend'

Dr. Humbolt intervenes, placing himself between you and Wells. 'There, there Wells. First thing to do is get you the help you need. Then we can help this 'Wanna' you're going on about.'

'Weena, you fool! Weena! I'm not crazy. He twists towards you. 'Filby, the Morlocks are going to kill her...' The rest of Wells' sentence is cut off as the orderlies gag him and roughhouse him into the ambulence."
