Part 1 - Beginning The Story

The player is in Woking Street.

[TBD Describe yourself when you "x self"]

When play begins: say "'Let me go!'

Wells struggles against the orderlies dragging him into the horse-drawn ambulence parked in the street before the door. With strength born of desperation he breaks free and falls to the ground, off balance by the straightjacket binding his arms to his sides. You kneel down and help him off the snow-covered bitumen, your eyes meeting.

'Save her,' he says, voice ragged and hoarse, eyes hopeful and pleading. 'Save Weena for me, my old friend'

Dr. Humbolt intervenes, placing himself between you and Wells. 'There my friend. First thing is to get you the help you need. Then we can help this 'Wanna' your obsessing about.'

'Weena, you fool! Weena! The Morlocks are going to kill her...' The rest of his sentence is cut off as the orderlies roughtly hoist Wells to his feet, gag him, and drag him into the ambulence.'"

[When play begins: say "'No! Let me go!'

Wells struggles against the two constables dragging him towards the ambulence parked in the street.  With strength born of desperation he breaks free and stumbles towards you, his balance affected by the straightjacket that binds his arms to his sides. He falls. You kneel down on the snow-covered cobblestones and grab Wells[apostrophe] shoulders. Your eyes meet.

'Save her,' Wells says, his voice ragged and hoarse, his eyes hopeful and pleading.

'Wells,' you say, 'you need help.' You look away from your friend's face, embarressed and ashamed.

'No!' he yells, struggling again as the constables drag him back to his feet and back towards the parked ambulance. As they begin hoisting him up the steps into the cab's interior he struggles weaken. Resigned to his fate, Wells finds your eyes one last time. His scream rents the crisp December night air. 

'You must save her! Save Weena! For the love of God...' The rest of Wells[apostrophe] cries are muffled as the two officers drag him into the dark interior of the ambulance. 

You make a move towards the ambulence but are stopped by Doctor Humboldt, the noted physician. 'Worst break with reality I've ever seen to date,' he says, his hand on your arm. 'Could be permanent but we won't know for sure until we get to the hospital and I get him sedated.'

Humboldt begins hoisting himself up into the ambulence after Wells and the constables. He turns back towards you. 'You should stay here. Search around, see if there's any proof to back up this fantastic story of his. I'll return as soon as I can and we can decide what future actions are necesary at that time.'

He shakes his head sadly, muttering to himself as he disappears inside the ambulence. 'Time travel, Morlocks...'

The ambulence door shuts. The driver cracks his whip and the vehicle pulls away from the curb. It makes are right turn at the end of the street, merges with the evening traffic, and disappears.
